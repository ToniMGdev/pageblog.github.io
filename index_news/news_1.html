                        <p>Light leaks used to be a shoot-from-the-hip technical flaw: you had to fix the analog camera
                            that exposed the film with extra diffuse light. Gladly, trends change and put a new spin on
                            defects of great diversity. Today, Lomography enjoyers choose extreme optical distortion and
                            rainbow-colored flashes over neat pictures. But are they even developing films in the
                            darkroom for real? Learning film photography from scratch is hard, but digital overlays are
                            no worse than spoiling meters of camera rolls. We invite you to try the Retro Prism Photo
                            Effects Collection to make the viewers groove with light leaks, embodying the manifesto of
                            hipster visuals.</p>
                        <p>The road back to the 2010s lies through a <strong>high-quality PSD file</strong> â€” we promise the trip will be
                            so much fun! We curated <strong>6 effects in horizontal and vertical versions</strong> to make the light
                            smear across all the artboards in every way possible: posters, tickets, invitation cards,
                            merch, you name it. Feel free (like it's still the golden age of young fellow millennials!)
                            to work with Smart Object layers to control your image's distortion, roughness, and color
                            tint for the best retro-inspired visual look.</p>
